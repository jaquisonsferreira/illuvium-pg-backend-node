## Title: Implement GraphQL Support for Enhanced API Flexibility and Performance

### Description

Currently, the Illuvium API is implemented as a REST API using NestJS. While this approach works well for many scenarios, implementing GraphQL support would provide several strategic advantages for our gaming platform ecosystem.

### Why GraphQL for Illuvium API?

#### 1. Optimized Data Fetching for Game Clients

- **Reduced Over-fetching**: Game clients often need specific data subsets. GraphQL allows clients to request exactly what they need, reducing bandwidth usage and improving performance on slower connections.
- **Reduced Under-fetching**: Eliminates the need for multiple round-trips to fetch related data (e.g., getting an asset and then its attributes in separate calls).
- **Particularly valuable for mobile game clients** where bandwidth optimization is crucial.

#### 2. Evolving API Without Versioning

- **Field-level Deprecation**: Can gradually evolve the API by deprecating individual fields rather than entire endpoints.
- **Non-breaking Additions**: New fields and types can be added without breaking existing clients.
- **Ideal for Games-as-a-Service** where the API needs to evolve alongside the game without disrupting the player experience.

#### 3. Improved Developer Experience

- **Self-documenting API**: GraphQL's introspection provides automatic, up-to-date documentation.
- **Strongly Typed Schema**: Ensures type safety across the entire API surface.
- **Better Tooling**: Enables powerful developer tools like GraphQL Playground and Apollo Explorer for testing and exploring the API.
- **Streamlined Integration for Game Studios**: Partners can more easily integrate with our ecosystem by querying exactly what they need.

#### 4. Perfect Fit for Our Clean Architecture

- **Clean Interface Layer**: GraphQL resolvers would fit neatly into our Interface layer of Clean Architecture.
- **Domain Isolation**: Our domain models remain unchanged; GraphQL types serve as presenters.
- **Use Case Reusability**: Existing use cases can be reused across both REST and GraphQL interfaces.

#### 5. Performance Benefits for Gaming Use Cases

- **Batched Queries**: Multiple resources can be requested in a single query.
- **DataLoader Pattern**: Prevents N+1 query problems when fetching related data (critical for asset collections, inventories, etc.).
- **Real-time Capabilities**: GraphQL subscriptions provide a standardized way to implement real-time features for live game updates.

#### 6. Specific Benefits for Illuvium's Domain

- **Complex Asset Queries**: Ideal for querying NFT assets with varying attributes and metadata.
- **Player Profile Customization**: Different game clients can request different profile information without API changes.
- **Game-specific Data Views**: Different Illuvium games can consume precisely the data they need.
- **Marketplace Integration**: Efficient queries for marketplace listings with specific attribute filters.

### Implementation Considerations

1. **NestJS Integration**: NestJS has first-class support for GraphQL using the `@nestjs/graphql` package with code-first approach.

2. **Coexistence Strategy**:
   - Initially implement GraphQL alongside existing REST endpoints
   - Create GraphQL equivalents for our most-used REST endpoints first
   - Eventually designate GraphQL as the preferred API method for new clients

3. **Clean Architecture Mapping**:
   - GraphQL resolvers would reside in the interface layer
   - GraphQL types would map to our DTOs
   - Existing use cases would be reused

4. **Security and Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement query complexity analysis to prevent abuse
   - Apply consistent authentication and authorization across both APIs
   - Ensure rate limiting works effectively with query batching

5. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Implement DataLoader pattern for efficient data loading
   - Consider persistence caching for frequently requested data
   - Monitor and optimize resolver performance

### Alignment with Business Goals

- **Improved Player Experience**: Faster API responses mean better in-game performance
- **Developer Ecosystem Growth**: Easier integration encourages more game studios to build on our platform
- **Future-Proofing**: Flexibility to evolve our data model as the games and ecosystem expand
- **Reduced Development Time**: Less need for specialized endpoints for different client requirements
